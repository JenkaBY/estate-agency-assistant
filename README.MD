Develop an AI-powered assistant for a real estate agency that assists potential buyers and renters in finding 
their ideal property. The assistant should engage users in a conversation, asking questions about their 
preferences such as location (city, neighborhood), budget range, property type (apartment, house, condo), 
number of bedrooms and bathrooms, desired amenities (parking, garden, pool), and proximity to schools 
or public transportation. While implementing this application use the simplest solutions to not over-complicate
and over-engineer the application. Use your favorite programming language, technology and tools. At the end,
you should be able to present your solution in the form of a demo.

Note: keep in mind that this is a simple task. Whenever you find yourself on a path that will take you more 
than a couple of hours, it is probably not a good path. This task is about using Generative AI LLM model.
